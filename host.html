                    <p>Here is a list of popular free website hosting services:</p>
                    <div class="all-sites">
                        <h3>what we have here &darr;</h3>
                        <h4><a href="#1">1.Infinity Free</a></h4><hr>
                        <h4><a href="#2">2.Byet Host</a></h4><hr>

                    <div class="sub-content" id="1">
                        <h3>1. <a href="https://www.infinityfree.net/" target="_blank"> Infinity Free</a></h3>
                        <a href="https://www.infinityfree.net/" target="_blank"><img src="img/infinityfree.webp" alt="Infinityfree"></a>
                        
                        <p>In the world of free website hosting, Infinityfree(opens in new tab) stands out for good reasons, which is why it's top of our best free website hosting list. It has a well-designed website that makes a positive impression and ticks the right boxes for us. Its homepage gets a C performance grade in our load time test but other than that, it looks pretty solid. <br><br>
                          
                        Infinityfree has been in the business for over six years, claims to have over 400,000 users, and offers unlimited disk space and bandwidth (albeit with a very generous 50,000 daily hits). You can host as many domains as you want but you will only get 10 email accounts and one FTP to upload your content. <br><br>
                        There are no hidden fees and despite its free status, you will get a 99.9% uptime guarantee (although that said, you are more or less on your own if your site goes down) and the popular Softaculous Script installer with more than 400 applications. <br><br>
                        We were surprised to see that this provider's features list includes 400 MySQL databases (where others give only a handful, if any at all), a free DNS service, free SSL and free Cloudflare CDN. That's impressive for a free offering. <br><br>
                        
                        As expected Infinityfree also sells cheap paid-for hosting ( <a href="https://www.infinityfree.net/premium/" target="_blank">Infinityfree Ultimate Premium </a>) that offers unlimited everything for $6.90 per month, which is worth an upgrade as you will also get access to CloudFlare Railgun, which cuts load times significantly. <br>
                        </p>
                    </div>



                    <div class="sub-content" id="2">
                        <h3>2. <a href="https://byet.host/" target="_blank"> Byte Host</a></h3>
                        
                        <a href="https://byet.host/" target="_blank"><img src="img/bytehost.png" alt="Byte Host"></a>
                        <p><a href="https://byet.host/" target="_blank">Byethost</a>  is part of Byet Internet, a US-based provider of hosting, domain name and reseller services. With more than one million websites hosted, Byethost claims that its free hosting service is "one of the most powerful networks dedicated solely to free hosting in the world." <br><br>
                           

                        Users are given 1GB of server space, 50GB monthly bandwidth and MySQL / PHP compatibility. They also benefit from 24/7 tech support, which is obviously a boon, as well as access to Byethost's community and knowledgebase. <br><br>

                        The Softaculous platform gives you automatic installation of WordPress and hundreds of other popular web applications, and there's a free website builder (with platforms) if you need it. It's ad-free, too. <br><br>
                        
                        Furthermore, if you are ever interested in becoming a free website hosting provider yourself, Byethost operates a separate entity, myownfreehost(opens in new tab), that allows you to do just that... <br>
                        </p>
                    </div>


                    
                    <div class="sub-content" id="3">
                        <h3>3. <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/" target="_blank"> 000webhost</a></h3>
                        
                        <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/"  target="_blank"><img src="img/000webhost.png" alt="000webhost"></a>
                        <p><a href="https://www.000webhost.com/"  target="_blank">000Webhost</a>  is a free website hosting provider owned and operated by Hostinger. 000Webhost has been around for 10 years and has millions of users, which unfortunately makes it a prime target for hackers. In 2015, the provider’s entire database was compromised with details of an estimated 13.5 million accounts stolen. Since then, 000Webhost has completely changed but many users still remember the hack to this day. <br><br>
                           
                       <p> With 000Webhost, you'll get cPanel, a website builder and a WordPress auto-installer, plus a further benefit is that there are no ads. However, the bandwidth and especially the disk space are on the low side, with 3GB bandwidth and only 300MB of disk space. <br><br>

                        As expected, there’s no SSL certificate, but what is slightly surprising is the absence of subdomains and email accounts, as well as a lack of support via tickets (you have to go through the forums when you need help). <br><br>
                        
                        You should be able to install two websites with 000Webhost, but we got an error message when we tried to do this a second time, saying that we had reached our limit. Furthermore, the account creation email was flagged by Google as a suspicious email, with a pop-up warning that malware often comes from that URL. Note that you can also create a website on 000webhostapp.com using the same credentials as 000webhost.com... <br>
                        </p>
                    </div>







                    <div class="sub-content" id="4">
                        <h3>4. <a href="https://googiehost.com/" target="_blank"> Googiehost</a></h3>
                        <a href="https://googiehost.com/"  target="_blank"><img src="img/googiehost.png" alt=""></a>
                        <p>You could easily confuse <a href="https://googiehost.com/" target="_blank">Googiehost</a>  with Googlehost, a cheeky way of getting some attention. However, the eight-year-old Googiehost still remains one of the better options in a not-so-great bunch of free website hosting providers.  <br><br>
                           
                        That said, the company's website inspires little confidence. The small print copyright notice was extended to 2021 even when it was the year 2018, presumably to protect against potential infractions by time travelers. Also, odd grammatical mistakes abound - Lastest, Trsuted, Powerfull - that sort of thing (and at the time of writing, there are apparently '2,12,820' users all over the world).<br><br>

                        Still, it's not all bad. This is the only provider here to come with cPanel and Cloudflare, albeit in its free form. However, note that we experienced a few instances where the dreaded “your connection is not private” popped up on our screen when trying to access cPanel. That's never a good sign as Chrome is identifying it as a “not secure” property. <br><br>
                        
                        Googiehost's revenue model relies on some of its free websites converting to paid-for affairs via Interserver.net. Plus it does run a few banner ads on the control panels and on its own website - but not on the users' sites... <br>
                        </p>
                    </div>







                    <div class="sub-content" id="5">
                        <h3>5. <a href="https://freehostingnoads.net/" target="_blank"> FreeHostingNoAds</a></h3>
                        <a href="https://freehostingnoads.net/"  target="_blank"><img src="img/freehostnoad.png" alt="FreeHostingNoAds"></a>
                        <p> Like Byethost, <a href="https://freehostingnoads.net/" target="_blank">FreeHostingNoAds</a>  delivers just what it says on the tin: Free website hosting without any adverts. The brand is owned by Runhosting(opens in new tab), an established web hosting provider that offers unlimited disk space and unlimited traffic for as little as $2.49 per month. <br><br>
                            
                        As expected, though, FreeHostingNoAds offers a small subset of what you get with a paid-for account and uses the same dashboard as Batcave(opens in new tab) (1GB/5GB/1 domain) and FreeHostingEU(opens in new tab) (200MB/4GB/5 domains). The latter are two other free website hosting providers that share an identical set of features with FreeHostingNoAds, and may well be part of the same family. <br><br>

                        An SSL certificate, which will give you the all-important security padlock in browsers, will set you back an eye-watering $30. The control panel, via Zacky Tools Installer, is extremely limited, with either Grav, WordPress or Joomla being offered as one-click installs. However, you will be able to install your own should you want to do so – but bear in mind that the file size limit is only 15MB. <br><br>
                        
                        Creating a new account is straightforward, but we were slightly concerned by the fact that the account emails landed straight in our spam box, a sign that some sites hosted by FreeHostingNoAds might be on a deny list... <br>
                        </p>
                    </div>







                    <div class="sub-content" id="6">
                        <h3>6. <a href="https://www.freewebhostingarea.com/" target="_blank"> FreeWebHostingArea</a></h3>
                        <a href="https://www.freewebhostingarea.com/"  target="_blank"><img src="img/freewebhostingarea.png" alt="FreeWebHostingArea"></a>
                        <p><a href="https://www.freewebhostingarea.com/" target="_blank">FreeWebHostingArea</a> might sport the design of a website from 1999, but it's another option if you want a free website hosting company that can give you unlimited bandwidth (or at least that's the provider's claim). <br><br>
                           
                  <br>
                        What's more, it offers a more generous storage capacity than most, giving you 1.5GB of web space, plus you get three MySQL databases - which again outperforms most rival free website hosting providers. <br><br>

                        The control panel is rudimentary, and at the time of writing, the site builder and the auto-installer were not working properly, leaving any user with the task of uploading their files via FTP if they want to create their own websites. The maximum file size allowed on FreeWebHostingArea is 12MB. <br><br>
                        
                        FreeWHA, as it is also known, also gives users daily or weekly offsite backups and no ads on low traffic websites. Upgrade to the FreeWHA Basic package(opens in new tab) for $12 a year and you get the ads removed regardless of how popular the site is, along with five MySQL databases per account, one-click database backup and priority technical support... <br>
                        </p>

                        <h2> Best free website hosting service FAQs</h2>

                    <div class="P/c">
                        <h3>Pros and cons of free website hosting</h3>
                        <p>There are way more cons than pros for free website hosting. The main (and only) pro is that it’s free, you really don’t pay a dime for it. This might be an okay choice for just trying out yourself in creating a website but you are almost always better off just paying for a good hosting provider, and there are some cheap ones too. </p><br><br>
                        <p>As you can imagine, there are quite a few cons to free website hosting. Performance is vastly inferior to paid hosting, security is questionable, don’t expect too much from customer support (if there’s any), and more often than not, you’re on your own if there’s some trouble with the website. All in all, if you can, stay away from free website hosting and pick a good cheap hosting provider.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="safe">
                        <h3>Is free website hosting safe?</h3>
                        <p>Free website hosting is as safe as any other hosting provider, with the caveat that less focus is provided on stability and support. This means you cannot presume that any backups will be made or will be reliable, so you must take extra steps to save and download your own data as required. That doesn't mean to say that free website hosting companies are bad or unreliable, just that with paid services you are paying for that stability, support, and reliability.</p><br><br>
                        <p>However, the bottom line is that while free website hosting can be great for small hobby websites, any serious website - even if it's just a contact page - needs to have it's own paid web hosting service. Not only does this imply extra protections for your website, but it also looks more professional if you don't have unnecessary website credits or even ads on your website. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="check">
                        <h3>Is free website hosting good?</h3>
                        <p>Yes and no, mostly no. While it is free, there are serious drawbacks to it. You are very limited with what you can do, a good deal of websites aren’t even secured properly, and if anything goes wrong you’re pretty much left to your own devices. </p><br><br>
                        <p>As we mentioned earlier, you’re better off choosing some cheap web hosting provider than going free. Still, it’s ultimately your choice, and free website hosting can be adequate for some specific situations, like newbies who want to dabble a bit with creating a website.</p>
