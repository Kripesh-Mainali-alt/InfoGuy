                    <p>Here is a list of popular free Domain services:</p>

                    <div class="sub-content" id="1">
                        <h3>1. <a href="https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank"> Freenom</a></h3>
                        <a href="https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank"><img src="img/freenom.png" alt="Freenom"></a>
                        
                        <p> The free domains are absolutely the best reason to choose Freenom, and the free WHOIS protection is a solid feature that should be standard everywhere. However, with the sparse UI, the limited feature set, and the unfortunate lack of full support for free domains, I can’t say that Freenom is one of the “best” domain name registrars.<br><br>
                            
                           <br>
                        You’d easily be better off going with Domain.com or Namecheap, as these registrars have loads of extra features to help you configure and protect your domain.But Freenom gives you free domain and provide many features, which is why it's top of our best free domain provider list. <br><br>
                        Only the .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, and .gq domains are free. And even then, you have to follow certain rules (no adult or gambling sites, no domain parking) and make sure to renew every year. And you can’t use popular keywords alone as your domain. Those are always expensive. Lastly, you don’t “own” your free domain, and it can be taken away at the discretion of the people who own the domain extension.<br><br>
                        
                        
                         
                        It’s no more or less safe than just about any other online service. From the perspective of a tech nerd, that’s a little bit terrifying because this whole system is a bit fragile and modern life depends… well, that’s a rant for another day.My point is, the company is legit. You need not worry too much about handing over your credit card information. And technically, you don’t need to hand it over at all.<br>

                        <a href="https://nc.me/" target="_blank"><img src="img/namecheap.png" alt="Namecheap"></a>
                        <p>For almost 20 years, Namecheap has been dedicated to making the internet accessible and affordable. In 2014, after years of championing this mission, leaders within the company came upon a unique opportunity to help spread innovation and creativity to the business leaders of tomorrow. This discovery led to the Namecheap University initiative, a program that has now helped more than 200,000 students by offering free domain names paired with complimentary website tools.<br><br>
                          
                            <br>

                        Through this initiative, anyone with an active .edu email address is eligible to receive a bundle of resources. This includes access to GitHub Pages and a .me website at no charge for one full year. Students, educators, and administrators can use these tools to create online resumes, publish their research, or participate in coding competitions. <br><br>
                        
                        Students and educators can still claim their free domain by visiting nc.me. While the initiative was originally designed to support individuals in higher education, the offering has also become a core part of the syllabus in several high school and college tech programs. Namecheap has incorporated the nc.me program into popular technology events and hackathons, giving participants access to domains and a selection of free web building resources.<br><br>
                        
                        In addition to the nc.me initiative, Namecheap also supports higher education programs like New York On Tech, who provide digital training to underrepresented high school students in the NYC area. The program helps students prepare for both academic and professional success, by offering real-world experience and creating connections with technology industry experts.<br>

                    <div class="P/c">
                        <h3>Pros and cons of free Domain</h3><br>

                        <h3>Pros</h3>
                        <p>1. Free domains offer one year free domain registration. so these free domains are useful for blogs or websites which remain alive less than one year. <br>
                        2. These are useful for websites of college fests,events,competitions etc. because these websites are used only till the completion of the event. after that they are not useful  so registering a free domain for this type of websites may save money. <br>
                        3. Useful for bloggers who want to maintain a blog just upto a period of one yearor less than that. <br>
                        4. many of the short period websites will depend on free domains inorder to save money. so these free domains are a gift to some of the short period websites.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3>Cons</h3>
                        <p>
                            1. Free domain offer domain registration free for only one year. After that you should pay for renewal for that domain. These are useful for only short period websites.  If you want to develop a website/blog for a long period, then don’t go for free domains. <br>
                            2. Free domains can't be indexed in search engines easily. if you want a good seo for your blog/website,  then forget about free domains and go for a paid domain.
                            <br>
                            3. Google may ban the free domains. if it happens to your domain service then your blog/website will be no more available in search engines. google has banned  .co.cc domain in past(now it is accepting). so if it repeats again then your website will be no more visible in search engines.  <br>
                            4. When you go for a free domain after one year you should change your domain. so when you change your domain after one year then you may loose all your visitors, seo, page rankings, back links, etc.
                        </p>
