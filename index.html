                        The Basic plan is good if you are only going to have 1 website and 10 GB of storage is enough for your project. It also has a limitation on the subdomains you can have, and the databases you can create.With the Plus plan, you can have as many websites as you need and double the storage of the Basic plan.If you get the Choice Plus package, you’ll be awarded with all the Plus features, plus free domain privacy and better backup options (for 1 year). It doesn’t really warrant the much higher price compared to the standard Plus plan.The Pro tier is suitable for those looking for higher performances. The maximum files you can host with this plan jumps from 200,000 to 300,000. It also has permanent advanced backup options.<br><br>
                        
                        Bluehost offers its customers a free SSL certification service.In an age of increasingly sophisticated hacking schemes for stealing or damaging a user’s data, an SSL certificate and HTTPS protocol tell visitors your site is trustworthy and secure and that their most sensitive data is safe with you.<br>

                        <h3>4. <a href="https://domains.google/" target="_blank"> Google Domain</a></h3>
                        
                        <a href="https://domains.google/"  target="_blank"><img src="img/googledoomain.png" alt="Google domain"></a>
                        <p>If you’re looking for a service to help you register a domain name, Google Domains is one of the best services you’ll find. In this Google Domains review, we’ll help you understand why we recommend Google Domains by offering comprehensive coverage of what this Google service has to offer. <br><br>
                          

                        When you register a domain name, you have to provide your own personal information, like your address and phone number.By default, all this information is publicly available in the Whois registry, which leaves you open to spam or other annoying/malicious activity.
                        Privacy protection changes that by hiding your information behind generic privacy information.Many domain registrars charge you for privacy protection, sometimes as much as $10 per year.Google Domains, however, includes privacy protection for free as part of your purchase.<br><br>

                        DNS, short for Domain Name System, is what connects your domain name to your web server. It’s often called the “phonebook of the Internet”.Each domain registrar has its own DNS service, as do many hosts.But here’s the thing:Not all DNS are created equal, and the DNS you use can have an effect on your page load times.With Google Domains, you get to use Google’s Cloud DNS, which is backed by Google’s own infrastructure. This delivers premium-level speeds at no extra cost to you.<br><br>
                      
                        If you want to use your own custom email address (like you@yoursite.com), Google Domains lets you create up to 100 email aliases that you can deliver to your existing email accounts, like Gmail.Or, it’s also super easy to hook Google Domains up to Google Workspace for email hosting, though you’ll need to pay extra for Google Workspace. <br>

                        <h3>5. <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/" target="_blank"> HostGator</a></h3>
                        
                        <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/" target="_blank"><img src="img/hostgator.png" alt="HostGator"></a>
                        <p>HostGator was founded in 2002 and grew quickly to become one of the biggest hosting companies in the world. You can credit the monstrous growth to their great shared hosting plans, reliable web hosting, and quality customer service.Today it is headquartered in Houston, Texas, and hosts over 10 million domains. They have 850+ employees that offer around-the-clock support and serve businesses of all sizes.It is a subsidiary of Endurance International Group and offers a wide range of web hosting solutions to a massive global customer base.<br><br>
                           

                        HostGator guarantees an uptime of 99.99%. If you experience downtime below that, then you will get back one month credit on your account.HostGator offers 45 days moneyback guarantee. Normally, web hosting companies do not offer a moneyback guarantee beyond 30 days. You can choose between monthly and yearly billing periods. Longer billing periods will get you the most discount.HostGator offers free migration service with all new accounts. Their expert team will transfer your website from your previous host at no extra cost during the first 30 days of signing up.<br><br>

                        What would you do if you sign up for a host and find that your website is painfully slow and often disappears? You’d have to switch providers, and this will cost you more money and headache.That’s why you want to choose a web hosting provider that is reliably fast with stable performance record all around.The content of your website significantly affects the page load time. For example, if your website has many images, then it will increase the page load time.This affects your server’s speed test results. We wanted to see how fast the HostGator server actually responds and it respond faster  than I thought.<br><br>
                        

                        HostGator is good for WordPress and highly recommended for anyone who wants to start a WordPress website.It offers 1-click WordPress installation which even lets you pick essential plugins and templates during setup. Plus you get 24/7 tech support which comes in handy for most beginners.<br>

                        <h3>Pros and cons of free website hosting</h3>
                        <p>There are way more cons than pros for free website hosting. The main (and only) pro is that it’s free, you really don’t pay a dime for it. This might be an okay choice for just trying out yourself in creating a website but you are almost always better off just paying for a good hosting provider, and there are some cheap ones too. </p><br><br>
                        <p>As you can imagine, there are quite a few cons to free website hosting. Performance is vastly inferior to paid hosting, security is questionable, don’t expect too much from customer support (if there’s any), and more often than not, you’re on your own if there’s some trouble with the website. All in all, if you can, stay away from free website hosting and pick a good cheap hosting provider.</p>

                        <p>Free website hosting is as safe as any other hosting provider, with the caveat that less focus is provided on stability and support. This means you cannot presume that any backups will be made or will be reliable, so you must take extra steps to save and download your own data as required. That doesn't mean to say that free website hosting companies are bad or unreliable, just that with paid services you are paying for that stability, support, and reliability.</p><br><br>
                        <p>However, the bottom line is that while free website hosting can be great for small hobby websites, any serious website - even if it's just a contact page - needs to have it's own paid web hosting service. Not only does this imply extra protections for your website, but it also looks more professional if you don't have unnecessary website credits or even ads on your website. </p>

                        <h3>Is free website hosting good?</h3>
                        <p>Yes and no, mostly no. While it is free, there are serious drawbacks to it. You are very limited with what you can do, a good deal of websites aren’t even secured properly, and if anything goes wrong you’re pretty much left to your own devices. </p><br><br>
                        <p>As we mentioned earlier, you’re better off choosing some cheap web hosting provider than going free. Still, it’s ultimately your choice, and free website hosting can be adequate for some specific situations, like newbies who want to dabble a bit with creating a website.</p>

                        <h3>Pros and cons of free Domain</h3><br>

                        <h3>Pros</h3>
                        <p>1. Free domains offer one year free domain registration. so these free domains are useful for blogs or websites which remain alive less than one year. <br>
                        2. These are useful for websites of college fests,events,competitions etc. because these websites are used only till the completion of the event. after that they are not useful  so registering a free domain for this type of websites may save money. <br>
                        3. Useful for bloggers who want to maintain a blog just upto a period of one yearor less than that. <br>
                        4. many of the short period websites will depend on free domains inorder to save money. so these free domains are a gift to some of the short period websites.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3>Cons</h3>
                        <p>
                            1. Free domain offer domain registration free for only one year. After that you should pay for renewal for that domain. These are useful for only short period websites.  If you want to develop a website/blog for a long period, then don’t go for free domains. <br>
                            2. Free domains can't be indexed in search engines easily. if you want a good seo for your blog/website,  then forget about free domains and go for a paid domain.
                            <br>
                            3. Google may ban the free domains. if it happens to your domain service then your blog/website will be no more available in search engines. google has banned  .co.cc domain in past(now it is accepting). so if it repeats again then your website will be no more visible in search engines.  <br>
                            4. When you go for a free domain after one year you should change your domain. so when you change your domain after one year then you may loose all your visitors, seo, page rankings, back links, etc.

                        <h3>Pros and cons of Premium website hosting</h3><br>

                        <h3>Pros</h3>
                        <h3> 1.Speed and Performance</h3><br>
                        <p>Paid hosting ensures a high speed and solid performance for your hosted services. <br>

                        Paid hosting providers invest into high-quality dedicated servers and prioritize server maintenance, thus allowing servers to maintain stable performance.
                            <br>
                            
                        On top of that, paid web hosting typically uses advanced technologies, such as solid-state drives (SSD) instead of hard disk drives, allowing for faster page load speed. <br><br>
                        </p>

                       <h3>2.Uptime and Reliability</h3><br>
                       <p>Most paid hosting providers guarantee a certain amount of uptime. <br>

                        For example, if your hosting provider guarantees 99.99% uptime, you won’t experience downtime longer than 1 hour throughout an entire year combined. <br>
                        
                        If, however, your web service experiences longer downtime, you’ll easily get your money back. <br>
                        As such, paid hosting is much more reliable, which allows you to avoid the negative impacts of server downtime, such as customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss.</p><br><br>
                        
                        <h3>3.Scalability</h3><br>
                        <p>Unlike free hosting, paid hosting supports server scaling. <br>

                            So, if your website or web app is gaining more traction, you can easily add more resources to your server so that it can handle more incoming traffic. <br>
                            
                            By scaling your website, you can effectively increase its performance and avoid downtime, even if your website experiences an unforeseen traffic spike.  <br><br></p>
                            <h3>4.Customer Support</h3><br>
                            <p>Paid hosting offers reliable and responsive customer support.<br>
                            Paid hosting, on the other hand, comes with real-time customer support that’s typically available 24/7/365 and via different channels. <br>
                            High-quality customer support is especially important when your web service experiences downtime as you can quickly get help and resolve the problem. <br>  <br> </p>

                            <h3>5.High-End Security</h3><br>
                            <p>Paid hosting provides high-end security, so you can be sure that your hosted services stay safe and secure from cyberattacks and malware. <br>

                                Depending on the specific hosting provider, paid hosting can come with software security, firewall, DDoS protection, malware scanning, and other security features. <br>
                                
                                What’s more, paid hosting comes with data backup, so, in case the files on your hosted service get corrupted, you can easily restore your data.</p><br><br>


                        <h3>Cons</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are not many cons  of premium hosting but for beginners you have  to pay a lot of money to  buy the premium hosting. 
                        </p>
