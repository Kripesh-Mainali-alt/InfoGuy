                        The Basic plan is good if you are only going to have 1 website and 10 GB of storage is enough for your project. It also has a limitation on the subdomains you can have, and the databases you can create.With the Plus plan, you can have as many websites as you need and double the storage of the Basic plan.If you get the Choice Plus package, you’ll be awarded with all the Plus features, plus free domain privacy and better backup options (for 1 year). It doesn’t really warrant the much higher price compared to the standard Plus plan.The Pro tier is suitable for those looking for higher performances. The maximum files you can host with this plan jumps from 200,000 to 300,000. It also has permanent advanced backup options.<br><br>
                        Bluehost offers its customers a free SSL certification service.In an age of increasingly sophisticated hacking schemes for stealing or damaging a user’s data, an SSL certificate and HTTPS protocol tell visitors your site is trustworthy and secure and that their most sensitive data is safe with you.<br>

                        <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/" target="_blank"><img src="img/hostgator.png" alt="HostGator"></a>
                        <p>HostGator was founded in 2002 and grew quickly to become one of the biggest hosting companies in the world. You can credit the monstrous growth to their great shared hosting plans, reliable web hosting, and quality customer service.Today it is headquartered in Houston, Texas, and hosts over 10 million domains.

If you experience downtime below that, then you will get back one month credit on your account.HostGator offers 45 days moneyback guarantee.

                        What would you do if you sign up for a host and find that your website is painfully slow and often disappears? You’d have to switch providers, and this will cost you more money and headache.That’s why you want to choose a web hosting provider that is reliably fast with stable performance record all around.The content of your website significantly affects the page load time. For example, if your website has many images, then it will increase the page load time.This affects your server’s speed test results. We wanted to see how fast the HostGator server actually responds and it respond faster  than I thought.<br><br>
                       
                        HostGator is good for WordPress and highly recommended for anyone who wants to start a WordPress website.It offers 1-click WordPress installation which even lets you pick essential plugins and templates during setup.

                        <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/"  target="_blank"><img src="img/dreamhost.png" alt="DreamHost"></a>
                        <p>DreamHost is one of the oldest and widespread providers in the industry. While its main focus lies on shared hosting, WordPress, it also offers VPS or private server hosting solutions for larger projects.As this host is no newcomer, you can find it being recommended all around. Surprisingly enough, the majority of them are very positive, praising its affordable prices, generous resources, good performance, and strong security. <br><br>
                            
                        DreamHost prices look very average from the first look, with shared hosting starting at $2.59/month. Other options include DreamPress managed WordPress platform, VPS (Virtual Private Servers) for more server control, and dedicated servers for the biggest websites.DreamHost has options to serve any kind of website and user. That’s great if you ever need an upgrade. But shared hosting is the way to go for most of the websites, so I’m interested in how good the value is of these plans.<br><br>

                        DreamHost is perhaps the only budget-friendly host that is brave enough to offer a 100% uptime guarantee and deliver it >99.99% of the time. Talking about speed, it’s similarly impressive and can load both light and heavy pages in a flash.DreamHost delivers reliable performance in the long run. And it did. 2 months and counting, I’ve got only 1 outage that equaled to >99.99% uptime rate. Just a minute short of the guarantee – Noone can complain about it.<br><br>
                        
                        Server response time was great as well, averaging at 231ms. While the shared hosting industry is known to average at around 600ms, this is really good.DreamHost delivers in terms of reliability. While it does not reach 100% uptime, it would be naive to think that it would.
                        <br><br>
                        In terms of security, DreamHost covers the basics and includes some more advanced stuff. All plans include SSL certificates, firewalls, daily backups, and domain privacy.Web Application Firewall comes with 100s of custom rules that filter the traffic that comes to your site. This way, you have basic protection from attacks on your site as well as bots.  <br>

                        <h2> Best Premium website hosting service FAQs</h2>

                    <div class="P/c">
                        <h3>Pros and cons of Premium website hosting</h3><br>

                        <h3>Pros</h3>
                        <h3> 1.Speed and Performance</h3><br>
                        <p>Paid hosting ensures a high speed and solid performance for your hosted services. <br>

                        Paid hosting providers invest into high-quality dedicated servers and prioritize server maintenance, thus allowing servers to maintain stable performance.
                            <br>
                            
                        On top of that, paid web hosting typically uses advanced technologies, such as solid-state drives (SSD) instead of hard disk drives, allowing for faster page load speed. <br><br>
                        </p>

                       <h3>2.Uptime and Reliability</h3><br>
                       <p>Most paid hosting providers guarantee a certain amount of uptime. <br>

                        For example, if your hosting provider guarantees 99.99% uptime, you won’t experience downtime longer than 1 hour throughout an entire year combined. <br>
                        
                        If, however, your web service experiences longer downtime, you’ll easily get your money back. <br>
                        As such, paid hosting is much more reliable, which allows you to avoid the negative impacts of server downtime, such as customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss.</p><br><br>
                        
                        <h3>3.Scalability</h3><br>
                        <p>Unlike free hosting, paid hosting supports server scaling. <br>

                            So, if your website or web app is gaining more traction, you can easily add more resources to your server so that it can handle more incoming traffic. <br>
                            
                            By scaling your website, you can effectively increase its performance and avoid downtime, even if your website experiences an unforeseen traffic spike.  <br><br></p>
                            <h3>4.Customer Support</h3><br>
                            <p>Paid hosting offers reliable and responsive customer support.<br>
                            Paid hosting, on the other hand, comes with real-time customer support that’s typically available 24/7/365 and via different channels. <br>
                            High-quality customer support is especially important when your web service experiences downtime as you can quickly get help and resolve the problem. <br>  <br> </p>

                            <h3>5.High-End Security</h3><br>
                            <p>Paid hosting provides high-end security, so you can be sure that your hosted services stay safe and secure from cyberattacks and malware. <br>

                                Depending on the specific hosting provider, paid hosting can come with software security, firewall, DDoS protection, malware scanning, and other security features. <br>
                                
                                What’s more, paid hosting comes with data backup, so, in case the files on your hosted service get corrupted, you can easily restore your data.</p><br><br>


                        <h3>Cons</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are not many cons  of premium hosting but for beginners you have  to pay a lot of money to  buy the premium hosting. 
                        </p>
